# Changelog

## 0.1.14 - Closed Tab Shadow Fix

### Fixed

- Fixed a faint gray stripe that appeared above and below the closed edge
  tab on the user's wallpaper. The native dock surface kept the full 24-28
  px ambient drop-shadow even when only the small tab was visible, so the
  shadow bled vertically beyond the tab. The closed state now drops the
  filter entirely; the ambient shadow returns the instant the panel opens.

## 0.1.13 - Premium UI Polish

### Added

- Added a shared motion, spacing, and radius design-token layer so every
  component now pulls easing curves, gaps, and corner radii from one place.
- Added a persistent left accent bar on focus-priority task rows so high-priority
  items are scannable without hover.
- Added an accent rail indicator that slides in beside the active sidebar
  section button as a clear "you are here" cue.
- Added a sticky settings drawer header with backdrop blur so the title and
  back action stay visible while scrolling long settings groups.
- Added micro-interactions: bell tilt when a reminder is queued, calendar event
  dots that grow on hover, and a check pop on task completion.
- Added prefers-reduced-motion guards so the section enter and per-row stagger
  animations are skipped for users who opt out.
- Added @media (hover: none) handling so row actions stay visible, reminder
  presets grow to 40 dp, and rail/calendar hit targets reach 38-44 dp on touch.

### Changed

- Polished the edge handle with a theme-aware border, layered drop shadow, and
  a dedicated dark-mode tone so it grounds against any palette without halo.
- Quieted shared icon button rest states across the rail, headers, capture row,
  and task rows: transparent at rest, soft surface tint on hover.
- Replaced the task row check button with a round outline that fills with the
  accent on hover and completion, matching modern task-app conventions.
- Removed card-in-card layouts: custom list titles became flat hover rows and
  pinned task lists no longer wrap their rows in a second bordered card.
- Reskinned the dock-edge picker, task-sort picker, and calendar entry-mode
  toggle as proper segmented controls with a single shared track.
- Modernized the settings toggle to fill with the active accent instead of
  going near-black or washed-blue depending on theme.
- Tuned settings sliders to use the active accent for the thumb with an
  accent-tinted halo that visually grounds in the surrounding row.
- Tightened section switch staggers from 158 ms to 128 ms and removed the
  rotation that was causing subpixel shimmer on horizontal text.
- Promoted the Apply settings button and destructive confirmation buttons to
  real primary actions (accent or red pills) so commits and deletes are
  unmistakable.
- Polished the calendar board, day cells, weekday header, today button, and
  agenda card into a coherent month view with tabular numerals throughout.
- Replaced the hard-coded red reminder badge on the edge handle with the
  active theme accent so the notification chip belongs to the current palette.
- Made the app icon tile theme-aware so it picks up the active accent instead
  of always reading as a dark chip.
- Auto-hid custom scrollbars unless the surrounding container is hovered so
  the side rail stays clean at rest.
- Refined every popover (reminder, delete confirm, theme dropdown, settings
  confirm) to a calmer two-layer shadow that adapts to dark mode.
- Aligned the section-heading counter, day-summary chips, and pinned list
  titles on consistent typography (-0.5% letter-spacing, tabular-nums).
- Mirrored the desktop polish on Android: thinner bubble handle stroke and
  card borders, pill-shaped primary buttons, flat task row backgrounds, and a
  matching ink-color sentence-case heading for settings sections.

### Fixed

- Stopped task row actions from translating on hover (no more 1 px shift).
- Stopped theme dropdown hover from matching the selected state so the current
  theme stays identifiable as the cursor moves through the menu.
- Stopped section group titles from rendering as tiny 9 px UPPERCASE muted
  text - they are now proper 11.5 px sentence-case ink-color headings.
- Stopped the calendar nav arrows from reading as inert because they no longer
  rely solely on the global icon-button hover.

## 0.1.12 - Desktop Motion Polish

### Added

- Added direction-aware, staggered transitions when switching between Today,
  Calendar, and Lists.
- Added smoke coverage that checks the rendered section transition animation
  hooks.

### Changed

- Made Windows and macOS desktop navigation feel smoother by animating the new
  section shell, primary blocks, and task rows as one coordinated transition.

## 0.1.11 - Android Companion

### Added

- Added a native Android companion APK to the release path.
- Added Android documentation for local release builds and overlay permission.
- Added Android release verification coverage alongside the desktop artifacts.

### Changed

- Aligned the Android companion version with the desktop app version.
- Made the Android floating handle use the full configured visible tab width,
  including better side and top dock sizing.
- Matched Android task metadata to the desktop language for Today and custom
  list capture.

### Fixed

- Fixed Android overlay service running-state reporting so the launcher screen
  reflects the actual floating sidebar service.
- Fixed Android open and close animation direction for right, left, and top
  dock placement.
- Fixed Android handle dragging so side docks move vertically and the top dock
  moves horizontally.
- Fixed Android reminder snooze routing so calendar and custom-list reminders
  update the correct task instead of always targeting Today.

## 0.1.10 - Quality Pass

### Added

- Added two extra curated theme presets so light and dark modes each expose six
  choices.
- Added a calm Today empty state for filtered or completed lists.
- Added a smoke assertion for the closed native dock state.

### Changed

- Simplified panel-width apply feedback so it stays neutral instead of turning
  into a bright blue Done state.
- Made task completion feedback local to the check button to avoid full-row
  flashes when reopening a task.
- Cleaned up pinned list separators and dark-mode task action button contrast.
- Calmed dark-mode scrollbars and sidebar rail button states.
- Neutralized the custom backdrop tint on the visible tab.
- Separated closed native dock stroke styling from the open panel shape.
- Made the edge picker visually directional.
- Softened quick-add focus treatment.
- Tightened calendar reminder controls and labels.
- Added icons to settings groups and removed duplicate theme mode copy.
- Expanded the visible tab size range.
- Lifted the custom theme dropdown above settings controls.
- Reduced native cursor passthrough latency.

## 0.1.9 - Hidden Gmail Foundation

### Added

- Added the first real Gmail integration foundation using direct Gmail API OAuth
  instead of MCP as the primary user flow.
- Added native Gmail OAuth loopback handling, PKCE, token exchange, refresh
  handling, and OS credential storage through Windows Credential Manager and
  macOS Keychain via the native layer.
- Added a user-facing Gmail connector settings section with disconnected,
  connected, reconnect, sync, disconnect, permission boundary, and activity
  audit states.
- Added Inbox suggestions for recent unread Gmail threads, with local convert
  to Todobar task, Gmail thread links, and local ignore state.
- Added browser smoke coverage for disconnected Gmail UI, connected mock state,
  revoked-token/reconnect state, and converting a mocked Gmail thread into a
  local task.

### Changed

- Moved Gmail MCP/developer setup out of the normal user flow. MCP remains a
  future advanced path, while direct Gmail OAuth is now the primary connector
  path.
- Hid the Gmail connector UI behind an internal feature flag until OAuth
  verification and public rollout are ready. The implementation remains in the
  codebase for future activation.

## 0.1.8 - Native Dock Polish

### Added

- Added collapsible settings groups to keep the settings drawer easier to scan.
- Added a non-connected Gmail MCP connector surface that documents the
  permission boundary without reading email data.
- Added Calendar entry mode controls so selected-day capture can create tasks
  or events.
- Added a hover-only visible tab setting for users who want the edge handle to
  stay hidden until the screen edge is hovered.
- Added persistent settings group collapse state.
- Added custom backdrop texture support to the visible edge tab/native dock
  surface, not just the open sidebar.

### Changed

- Refined task list row radii so hover and completed states keep rounded
  corners in Today, Calendar, Lists, and pinned list sections.
- Restored a lightweight border around pinned task groups without bringing back
  card-in-card list containers.
- Made hover-only tab mode use a narrow invisible edge reveal zone so the full
  hidden button area can stay click-through until the cursor reaches the screen
  edge.
- Tuned dark-mode settings scrollbars and the Calendar Today button to match
  the active theme more cleanly.
- Reduced native hover/click-through hit-test polling frequency to lower idle
  CPU use while keeping the edge reveal responsive.
- Made native edge hover detection faster while keeping the idle polling slower.
- Reduced native dock shadow weight so the tab column does not leave a heavy
  dark strip beside the panel.
- Toned down custom backdrop imagery inside the native dock/tab surface so the
  open button stays visually attached to the sidebar instead of picking up a
  strong blue image cast.
- Let the native SVG dock surface own the sidebar material instead of covering
  it with a rectangular sidebar background, so the tab connection reads as one
  continuous shape.
- Added a dimmed custom backdrop treatment to the settings drawer.
- Increased spacing between pinned Today list groups so dividers do not sit too
  close to the previous task row.
- Made task completion and reopening feel smoother without replaying the row
  entrance animation.
- Flattened pinned list and custom list sections to avoid card-in-card layouts.
- Reduced heavy dark-mode gradients, rail icon bevels, and settings control
  contrast.
- Reworked the themed scrollbar styling for the sidebar, settings, and theme
  picker surfaces.
- Reworked panel-width Apply feedback to stay pale instead of switching to a
  bright blue Done state.
- Added pointer-based section reordering in settings so Today, Calendar, and
  Lists can be dragged more reliably.
- Clarified the Surface opacity setting and the Gmail MCP permission boundary.
- Made Surface opacity visibly affect the settings drawer/native panel instead
  of only subtly changing the main task panel.
- Prefilled Gmail MCP setup with Google's Workspace MCP endpoint and an OAuth
  client ID field for the future native auth runner.

### Fixed

- Fixed hover-only tab reveal in the native desktop shell so right, left, and
  top docks expose the invisible edge trigger inside the visible tab strip.
- Fixed hover-only native reveal so moving the mouse anywhere along the screen
  edge reveals the button instead of requiring the button itself to be hovered.
- Removed the experimental panel-edge resize handle after it proved too easy to
  trigger accidentally and visually too noisy for the dock edge.

## 0.1.7 - Performance and Personalization

### Added

- Added task sorting controls so lists can stay priority-first, newest-first,
  or oldest-first without changing the stored tasks.
- Added custom backdrop image support with strength, dim, and blur controls for
  users who want a more personal desktop overlay.
- Added a 10-minute snooze action to custom reminder toasts.

### Changed

- Debounced local task, custom-list, and settings persistence so normal typing
  and slider movement do less synchronous storage work.
- Indexed calendar reminder counts once per render instead of filtering all
  tasks for every visible calendar day.
- Reworked the staged panel-width setting so Apply no longer gets squeezed next
  to the range control.

### Fixed

- Fixed light-mode reminder toast colors so in-app alerts follow the active
  theme instead of looking like a dark OS notification.

## 0.1.6 - Sidebar Polish and Reminder Badges

### Added

- Added a redesigned sidebar shell with a right-side command rail and compact
  planning status strip.
- Added a custom mode-aware theme dropdown with five light presets and five dark
  presets.

  custom Todobar reminder toasts that avoid OS notification chrome.

  rearranged from settings.

  the primary toggle shortcut, with `Alt + Shift + T` as a fallback.
- Removed the translucent Lumen/Smoke preset and kept the picker focused on
  solid, readable light and dark themes.
- Widened the top dock layout and expanded handle size controls.
- Added confirmation UI for reset, task delete, and custom-list delete while
  preserving Shift-click as the immediate delete path.
- Reworked task sections from stacked cards into calmer command rows with
  subtler action chrome and no hover lift.
- Increased the default sidebar width for a less cramped open-source first-run
  experience while keeping panel width configurable.
- Made task and quick-add hover states calmer so controls no longer float upward
  during normal pointer movement.
- Memoized task rows and added lightweight rendering containment for long task
  lists.
- Simplified the sidebar rail into icon-only controls to avoid clipped labels
  and keep the panel calmer.
- Replaced handle top/middle/bottom presets with clearer screen-edge docking
  controls for right, left, and top placement.
- Replaced the top stats strip with a single quiet Today progress bar.
- Reworked settings sizing so panel width is staged with an Apply action instead
  of resizing the window while the slider moves.
- Combined window and handle controls into a tighter settings group and ordered
  Screen Edge controls as Left, Right, then Top.
- Refined task, calendar, settings, and list buttons with square hit targets,
  soft-ui bevels, pressed states, and task action tooltips.
- Removed the duplicate per-section Today meter so the sidebar has one progress
  bar at the top.
- Added drag-and-drop section ordering while keeping the small arrow controls as
  an accessible fallback.
- Moved reminder alerts to a bottom toast position and added a red handle badge
  for due reminders when the sidebar is closed.

### Fixed

- Fixed clipped quick reminder controls by letting the reminder editor expand in
  flow instead of rendering outside its section.
- Fixed reminder date focus styling so it no longer shows a harsh blue ring that
  appears cut off.
- Fixed native monitor targeting by resolving the monitor under the cursor before
  falling back to the current window monitor.
- Fixed reminder alerts opening the full sidebar automatically when they become
  due.
- Fixed task action tooltips and delete confirmations being trapped under task
  row layers.
- Fixed startup monitor targeting in the native shell by using the cursor monitor
  before falling back to the current window monitor.

  Playwright smoke tests, and the no-bundle native Tauri build.
- Release automation publishes Windows, macOS Apple Silicon, and macOS Intel
  artifacts from the `v0.1.6` tag.

## 0.1.5 - Native Shortcut Fix

### Fixed

- Moved the toggle shortcut registration from the focused React webview into the
  native Tauri layer, so the global toggle can open Todobar from another app
  without clicking the sidebar first.

### Added

- Added `Alt + Shift + T` as a global toggle fallback.
- Extended project verification so native shortcut registration remains covered.
